### WMoments React Native App

I built an application to store any moments from life. All you need is your mobile camera.

It connects to SQLite database and stores data locally. Pictures move from cache to application files, so they won't delete automatically. Feel free to use!

##### Build instructions

1. Open the `wmoments` directory
2. Run `npm install` in `wmoments`. This should download and create the directories for the project.
3. Run `npm run start` to start the server to deliver the bundle url. Make sure this is running before you start your application.
